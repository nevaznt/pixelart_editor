Pixelart editor written python with the pygame module.  
The text input might feel a little weird because I decided to write myself. It would probably be better to use something like tkinter (tkinter is used, but only for importing and exporting the image), but I'm so used to pygame that using anything else would take me much more time.

Dependencies: pygame module

Use:
  Export with CTRL+S  
  Zoom with mouse wheel  
  Move the canvas by holding mouse wheel and moving your mouse  
  CTRL+T centers the canvas and the tool selection bar to left corner  
  Change the shape tool's shape by clicking on it.  
  
Some shortcut:  
  Pencil: p    
  Eraser: e    
  Color picker: c    
  Bucket fill: f  
  Shape tool: s   
  Outline Shape tool: a  
  Palette slots: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0
